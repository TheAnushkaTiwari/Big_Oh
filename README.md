Campus Navigator & Event Hub – Optimized Features & Strategy
 1. Event Management System
   •	Enhanced Event Categorization:
      Events are segmented into five core categories: Tech, Sports, Cultural, Social, and Hostel-Based Events. Each category 
      includes subcategories for better browsing (e.g., Tech → Hackathons, Seminars; Sports → Cricket, Badminton).
      A “Trending Events” section based on popularity or engagement metrics (likes, interest clicks) helps users discover hot 
      events easily.
    •	Subscription-Based Notifications:
      Users can subscribe to specific clubs or individual events to receive real-time notifications and updates. This ensures 
      they never miss announcements, changes, or last-minute updates.
    •	Event Highlights:
      Clubs can upload teaser videos, posters, and short descriptions to attract more participants and build excitement.
    •	Club Committee Interviews:
      Clubs can also list their upcoming committee interviews on the app to attract new student members, building 
      transparency and reach.
    •	Form-Based Registration:
      Instead of direct registration within the app, clubs will provide external form links (Google Forms, etc.) for each 
      event, preserving flexibility.
    •	One-Tap Calendar Sync:
      Users can sync events they are interested in or participating in directly with their Google Calendar or iOS Calendar.

2. Team Formation
•	AI-Based Team Suggestions:
A smart matching algorithm recommends potential teammates (if needed) based on shared interests, skills (entered during profile creation).

3. Feedback and Ratings
•	Verified Feedback System:
Participants can rate events using a unique code-based mechanism to ensure authenticity.
Qualitative feedback is also encouraged: “What did you like/dislike about the event?”
•	Club Performance Dashboard:
Clubs can track cumulative ratings, participation data, and feedback trends, creating a leaderboard-style system that promotes healthy competition.

4. Personalized Scheduling
•	Dynamic Event Optimization (USP):
Advanced scheduling algorithms (e.g., job sequencing, time-slot optimization) create a personalized itinerary based on user interests and priorities.
•	Conflict Alerts & Alternatives:
Users get alerts if chosen events overlap and are provided with smart alternatives or re-sequencing suggestions.

5. Real-Time Navigation
•	Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation (USP):
Integrated AR uses smartphone cameras to show live directional arrows or markers guiding users to event venues.
•	Accessibility Features:
Highlights wheelchair-accessible routes, elevators, and ramps to support differently-abled users.
•	Future Additions:
In future versions, the app may integrate downloadable campus maps and Bluetooth beacon support for hyper-accurate indoor navigation.

7. Visitor Mode
•	For Non-College Visitors:
A limited-access mode lets guests explore key campus landmarks (library, auditorium, cafeteria) with AR navigation and view a live feed of ongoing events to spark interest in future participation.

8. Emergency Assistance
•	SOS Button:
During large fests or night events, users can press an SOS button to request instant help or get venue guidance from campus volunteers.
9.Smart Access Control for Enhanced Security and Authenticity
The app includes a robust filter system based on user authentication. Students logging in with their verified college Outlook ID will have full access to features such as event feedback, polls, and interactive discussions. In contrast, visitors or users without a college ID will have limited access, restricted to navigation tools and event previews only.
•	This ensures that all feedback and comments come from genuine participants, preventing misuse, spam, or anonymous harsh remarks. It fosters a safe and accountable environment for event engagement and club interactions.
•	We will ask the user about their accommodation (Hostel/Day Scholar)

Why We Stand Out:
1.	Dynamic Event Optimization:
Solves a real problem for students juggling multiple events by organizing their schedule intelligently.
2.	AR Navigation:
A visually impressive feature that also provides true value, especially in large campuses.
3.	Visitor Mode:
Extends the platform’s use case and brings non-students into the campus culture.
4.	Club Subscriptions + Event Alerts:
Highly personalized user experience that ensures students stay connected with the activities they care about most.
5.	Day Scholar Transport Feature:
A thoughtful, real-world solution that shows empathy for a commonly overlooked user group.
6.	Gamification (Optional Add-On):
Leaderboards, points for attending events, and badges can be layered in to encourage participation and app engagement.

Future Plans :
 
•	Cab/Bus Coordination for Overnight Events:
A special feature allows day scholars to connect and coordinate shared transport options for overnight or late-night events. This ensures safe and cost-effective travel.
•	Offline Navigation: For places with unstable internet connections users can download maps.
•	Bluetooth Beacons: These are small Bluetooth devices which can be installed at various location in the campus and can be connected to mobile phones through Bluetooth instead of GPS as it may be non-functional various times.
